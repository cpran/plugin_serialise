Description:
  Short: read/write JSON or YAML Praat objects
  Long: >
    Working with Praat normally means interacting with several different types
    of objects, representing different abstractions within the program.
    However, the way in which Praat saves these to disk is highly
    idiosyncratic, and although there are some non-Praat parsers written for
    the most common object types, they have limitations.

    This plugin attempts to solve this by allowing the serialisation and
    deserialisation of most Praat object types into either YAML or JSON. The
    benefit of using these serialisation standards is that their use is
    widespread, and parsers and validators are everywhere.

    Included in the plugin are Perl scripts to handle the heavy-lifting of the
    conversion, and Praat wrappers to facilitate the reading and writing of
    serialised files from within the Praat GUI.
